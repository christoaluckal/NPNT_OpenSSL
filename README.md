# NPNT_OpenSSL
NPNT using OpenSSL CMD/CXX API

Signing <br>
`openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.pem -out binsign.sha256 perm.txt` <br>

Creating signature txt in base64 <br>
`openssl base64 -in binsign.sha256 -out signature.txt` <br>

Converting base64 signature to binary <br>
`openssl base64 -d -in signature.txt -out binsign.sha256` <br>
OR <br>
Copy contents of signature.txt to a new text file and read that into a new binary file <br>
`openssl base64 -d -in copy_signature.txt -out copybin.sha256`

Verifying <br>
`openssl dgst -sha256 -verify publickey.pem -signature binsign.sha256 perm.txt` <br>
OR <br>
`openssl dgst -sha256 -verify publickey.pem -signature copybin.sha256 perm.txt`

### FILE DESCRIPTIONS
1. binsign.sha256 : Signature BIN file created during first signing using Private Key
2. bk.txt : Backup of the data that is being signed
3. cmdsign.cpp : Command Line OpenSSL CXX code
4. copy_signature.txt : The Base64 encoded signature is copied directly into this
5. copybin.sha256 : This is the binary generated by the copied data
6. createsign.cpp : TODO
7. perm.txt : The data that is being signed
8. private.pem : Private Key
9. publickey.pem : Public Key
10. signature.txt : This is created from the binsign.sha256 binary file
